## Problem Statement:
In order to gain deeper insights into our pizza sales data and enhance business performance, we need to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize various aspects of our sales trends. This entails calculating essential metrics and presenting them in visually informative charts.

## KPIs Requirement:
The project aims to calculate the following KPIs:

### 1.Total Revenue
### 2.Average Order Value
### 3.Total Pizzas Sold
### 4.Total Orders
### 5.Average Pizzas per Order
### 6.Charts Requirement:

To gain insights and understand key trends, the following charts will be created:

### 1.Daily Trend for Total Orders (Bar Chart)
### 2.Hourly Trend for Total Orders (Line Chart)
### 3.Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category (Pie Chart)
### 4.Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size (Pie Chart)
### 5.Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category (Funnel Chart)
### 6.Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold (Bar Chart)
### 7.Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold (Bar Chart)

## Project Execution:
The project commenced with the extraction of pizza sales data, consisting of 50,000 rows, which was loaded into SQL Workbench. SQL queries were executed to compute the KPIs outlined in the problem statement. Following this, the data was exported to Excel for further processing.

In Excel, the data underwent necessary cleaning and transformation. Pivot tables were created to facilitate calculations for the identified KPIs. The computed KPIs were then cross-validated with the results obtained from SQL queries to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Dashboard Creation:
Utilizing the cleaned and validated data, a visually appealing dashboard was crafted to showcase the calculated KPIs and charts. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of pizza sales performance, enabling stakeholders to glean actionable insights and make informed decisions.

## Conclusion:
The Pizza Sales Dashboard project successfully leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to provide valuable insights into sales trends and performance metrics. By integrating SQL, Excel, and visualization tools, the project offers a holistic approach to understanding and optimizing business operations in the pizza industry.
